# EEG Classification Refactoring Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of refactoring the EEG classification codebase while maintaining its structural logic and workflow.

## Refactoring Checklist

### Code Analysis
- [x] Review helpers.py for refactoring opportunities
- [x] Review mental_state_inference.py for refactoring opportunities
- [x] Review unsupervised.py for refactoring opportunities
- [x] Review supervised.py for refactoring opportunities

### Addressing Warnings
- [x] Fix DtypeWarning in CSV loading (helpers.py:879)
- [x] Fix FutureWarning in DataFrame.fillna usage (helpers.py:1050)
- [x] Fix the line outside of a function error (df_features = process_features(df_features))

### Structure Improvements
- [x] Create consistent API interfaces across modules (mental_state_inference.py, supervised.py, unsupervised.py)
- [x] Improve error handling and logging (all modules)
- [x] Add type hints for better code readability (all modules)
- [x] Organize code into logical components (class-based approach in all modules)
- [x] Split helpers.py into smaller, more focused modules

### Documentation
- [x] Add/improve docstrings (all modules)
- [x] Update README with refactored code usage
- [x] Document the data processing pipeline (through comprehensive class structures and README)

### Testing
- [ ] Ensure refactored code maintains original functionality
- [ ] Add unit tests where appropriate

## Progress Log
- [2023-03-13] Started refactoring project
- [2023-03-13] Fixed warnings in helpers.py:
  - Added low_memory=False parameter to pd.read_csv to address DtypeWarning
  - Replaced deprecated fillna(method='ffill').fillna(method='bfill') with modern ffill().bfill() methods
- [2023-03-13] Enhanced helpers.py structure:
  - Added proper type hints using Python's typing module
  - Improved error handling with try-except blocks and detailed error messages
  - Added a logging system for better debugging
  - Enhanced docstrings with Args, Returns, and Raises sections
- [2023-03-13] Refactored mental_state_inference.py:
  - Implemented a class-based structure for better organization
  - Added proper type hints
  - Improved error handling and added logging
  - Enhanced docstrings with detailed information
  - Created a clean API for mental state inference operations
- [2023-03-13] Refactored supervised.py:
  - Created SupervisedModelTrainer class with comprehensive methods for the ML workflow
  - Added proper type hints for all methods and parameters
  - Implemented robust error handling with detailed error messages
  - Added comprehensive docstrings with Args, Returns, and Raises sections
  - Created methods for data preparation, model creation, training, evaluation, and model persistence
- [2023-03-13] Refactored unsupervised.py:
  - Created UnsupervisedModelTrainer class with comprehensive clustering capabilities
  - Added functionality for data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and cluster optimization
  - Implemented proper type hints, error handling, and logging
  - Added detailed docstrings for all methods
  - Created evaluation methods specifically for unsupervised learning
- [2023-03-13] Split helpers.py into multiple modules:
  - Created utils/ package with logging.py and common.py
  - Created data_loading.py for data loading functions
  - Created preprocessing.py for data preprocessing and feature engineering
  - Created bundles.py for time series bundle management
  - Created visualization.py for plotting and visualization functions
- [2023-03-13] Fixed the line outside of function error in helpers.py
- [2023-03-13] Updated __init__.py to import from the new modules

## Next Steps
- Add unit tests to ensure the refactored code maintains the original functionality
- Create example scripts showing the complete workflow from data loading to model training and inference
- Consider adding CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
