# Coding workflow preferences

- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly structed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes.
- Always maintain and update progress.md with steps and check boxes like a todo list for continuation between chats/agents.
